#projet 1
titre_projet_1 | Muscle actuators inspired 
descriptif_projet_1 | Damage of an actuator may jeopardize the functioning of a machine or a vehicle. Hence, critical motions are often ensured by redundant actuators. However, for some vehicles or applications, redundancy is not permitted, either because of steric hindering (e.g. for helicopters) or because of weight cost as for aeronautical and spatial applications. The aim of the project is to draw inspiration from the outstanding mechanical behaviour of muscles to create a delocalised actuator resilient to damage. 

#projet 2
titre_projet_2 | Impacts of pressurized membranes
descriptif_projet_2 | Pressurised membranes are used in various situations involving humans (protections, sports, etc). In this context, impacts mechanics of membranes is critical since under or over inflated membranes may create injuries. Both gas pressure and impact speed decrease contact time. Direct measurements of gas pressure and temperature variations (few degrees at each impact !) indicate an adiabatic compression in strong interaction with the membrane. The gas compression makes the impact with a pressurized membrane non-linear. 

#projet 3
titre_projet_3 | Head impacts: prevention and protection
descriptif_projet_3 | Brain damages consecutives to head impacts cannot be diagnosed immediately. This leads to underestimation of injury seriousness and renewed risk-taking before recovery. There is no effective therapeutic solution for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), making it even more urgent to improve injury prevention devices.
